# Lecture 19: Bug Tracking

Why a spreadsheet is not enough:

- Lack of communication: difficult to have a conversation about each bug.
- Lack of visibility: conversations happen via email which cannot be seen by different team members.
- Lack of real-time updates: no formal notification of new bugs, progress, and updates.
- Lack of fluid priorities: difficult to reprioritise bugs and problems.
- Lack of central repository: descriptions, screenshots, feedback, etc. not in the same location.
- Lack of insights: difficult to see patterns and trends.
- Lack of integration with other work: bug-tracking is in a silo.  This goes against the single repository of truth pattern.

Stages of bug-tracking:

- Capturing.
- Prioritizing.
- Tracking.
- Releasing.

Tracking a bug in the Backlog:

1. Check for duplicate bugs.
2. Create a new bug issue.
3. Prioritise and assign.
4. Fix the bug.

Description of a bug:

- What happens?
- When does it happen?
- Does it always happen?
- Under what circumstances is it happening now?
- What steps can you take to reproduce the event?

Issues in Backlog fields:

- Assignee.
- Priority.
- Milestone.
- Category.
- Version.
- Start date.
- Due date.
- Estimated hours.
- Actual hours.

Best practices:

- Be comprehensive:
  - Valid.  Is it actually a bug?
  - Complete. Does the bug include title, description, screenshots, etc?
  - Unique. Has the bug already been reported?
  - Reproducible. What steps are taken to reproduce the problem?
- Think it through.
- Keep your eyes peeled.

Bug reporting types:

- Internal (from testing).
- External (from user feedback).
